These are the files I created while learning ML with @TechWithHasanAbbasi YouTube channel.

I performed a project on breast cancer data available at scikit learn library using two models along with comparison in projects folder.

### List of the Machine Learning algorithms I learned in this program:
1. Naive Bayes
2. KNN
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. SVM
6. Logistic Regression
7. ANN
8. K means
